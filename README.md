Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 
Is the process of developiing, designing, testing and maintaining a software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
software engineering is the process of developing, designing, testing and maintaining a software, it is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software while traditional programming is centred on the code only.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Its a process model used to design, develop and test good quality software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 
Agile model is a type of a model in the Software development process that is based on the iterative development of software products while Waterfall model It is a fundamental model of the Software Development Life Cycle  which is used to develop softwares.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
In Agile model changes can be made at any stage while in Waterfall model changes cannot be made after completion of a phase.
In Agile model client input is required throught the product development while in Waterfall model client input is required only after completion of each phase.
In Agile the cost development is cheap compared to Waterfall model.
Agile method completes projects in comparatively a short time compared to Waterfall model.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering - Is a systematic and strict approach to the defination, creation, verification of requirements for a software system.
Requirement engineering it involves testing the requirements to ensure that they are valid and that the software system being developed will meet the user needs.

Importance of requirement engineering in SDLC

It informs the project manager dealing with the project what is needed to be done.
It helps ensure that the final product meet all user needs.
It is use to reduce software errors during the time of its development.

Software Design Principles:
Is a systematic and a systematic and disciplined approach to designing, developing and maintaining software systems.

Explain the concept of molarity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Molarity it is defined as dividing a system into separate modules since each module handles a specific fuctionality and also operates differently.
Throughy dividing systems into separate modules, developers can manage,update and scale parts of the application independently.
Testing in Software Engineering:
It is the process of evaluating that a software product or application does what is assinged to do.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing
It is normally performed early in the development process by engineers themselves.
Intergration testing
It is aimed to detecting the flaws in the interactions between the units within a module.
System testing
It usually tests the whole system in general making sure it does not contain any kind of a problem.
Acceptance testing
It is where the product is validated aganist the end user requirements, it is usually the last stage.

Version Control Systems:
They are  usually a systems that keeps track of every modification to the code in a specific kind of a database.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems
They are  usually a systems that keeps track of every modification to the code in a specific kind of a database.

Importance of version control system in software development
They normally keep track of every action happening in the system.
It has improved productivity compared to other systems.
It optimizes each and every resource used during the software development process.

Examples of popular versions
Git(Distributed)- It is a virtual control system known for its speed and efficiency.

Features 

Compatibility 
Git is compatible with all  the operating systems that are beingv used this days example Windows.

Non linear development
Git allows users all over the world to perform operations on a project remotly.

Branching
It allows its users to work on aline that runs parallelto the main project line.

Light weight
Git stores all the data from the central repository on the local repository while cloning is done.

Software Project Management:
It is a part of project management in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored ang controlled.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manager
He/ she plans the outcomes of a project like righting the oftware proposal.
He/ she acts as an intermediary between the development team and the other stake holders in a software project.

Responsiblity of project managers
To plan and develop the projects idea.
Create and lead the development team who will develop the software projects.
To ensure that customers needs are meet.
Evalute how the project has been done by the developers.

Challenges faced in managing the software project

Insufficient team skills
When developing projects it requires alot of skills from the team so as to make it a success but if theydo not have the skills it can be hard to do the job.

Lack of acccountabilty
Each and every memeber developing the project shopuld be accountable for his/ her mistakes and face the consequences if not it may lead to challenge.

Unrealistic deadlines
When developers are developing a complex software project they shoul be given more time to do so if not the project outcome may not be appealing.

Software Maintenance:
Is the process of updating, changing and modifying a process so as to meet the customer needs required.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software mainteinace Is the process of updating, changing and modifying a process so as to meet the customer needs required.

Types of mainteinace activities
Perfective mainteinace
Corrective mainteinance
Preventive mainteinance
Predictive mainteinannce

It helps prevent any problems with the software like viruses attack, loss of data and also shutting down of the software, when a mainteinace is done all this errors can be noticed earlier hence protecting the  system.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Data privacy- the users personal data should be handled with care if not it can be assessed by unauthorized person hence using the data for hi/her benefit.
Wrong priorities
A software engineer may focus alot on deloping new feartures and functionality hence neglect the customized and improve existing fuctions.
Lack of skills
This is usually a big challenge bsince if their is no enough skills to develop the softwares hence it would be all in vain.

How software engineers may adhere to their standards 

Ensure software is reliable, safe and  meets customers need.
They should be accountable for any kind of a mistake hence they should face the consequences.
They should have training first before doing any skill.
Their should rewards for people who have shown the ethical  behaviour in their work.
They should act as good role models for each other.

I have used some refference from geeksforgeeks platform.
